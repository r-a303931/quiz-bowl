# quiz-bowl

Nothing special, just a quizbowl game to end your search... once it's done

## Install

I will use `electron-builder` to create installers, but until then there are a variety of ways to set this up and run it:

1. Download the package
    There are a couple ways to do this:
    * `git clone https://github.com/r-a303931/quiz-bowl.git`
    * Download zip and unzip it

2. Run `npm install` in project directory
3. Run `npm start` in project directory
